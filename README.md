# Network Intrusion Detection

This repository contains the implementation of a network intrusion detection system using ensemble learning and different feature selection techniques.

## Datasets

The following datasets were used in this project:

1. **NSL-KDD**: A dataset that improves upon the KDD Cup 1999 dataset, containing various network traffic features and attack types.
   - [NSL-KDD Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hassan06/nslkdd)

2. **UNSW-NB15**: A comprehensive dataset with a wide range of modern attack types and normal network traffic.
   - [UNSW-NB15 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mrwellsdavid/unsw-nb15)

3. **CICIDS2017**: A dataset that includes various network traffic data with different types of attacks.
   - [CICIDS2017 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chethuhn/network-intrusion-dataset)

4. **KDD Cup 1999**: A classic dataset used for intrusion detection, containing a large amount of network traffic data.

## Approach

The project follows a structured approach to build and evaluate network intrusion detection models:

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- **Data Loading**: The datasets are loaded and combined for comprehensive analysis.
- **Feature Engineering**: Relevant features are selected, and categorical variables are encoded.
- **Normalization**: Features are normalized to ensure consistent scaling.

### 2. Feature Selection
- **AutoML Feature Selection**: Techniques like TPOT are used to automatically select the best features.
- **Hybrid Feature Selection**: Combines filter and embedded methods to select the most relevant features.
- **Lasso and Tree-based Feature Selection**: Utilizes Lasso regression and tree-based models for feature importance.
- **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)**: Ranks the features based on their importance, removes the least important feature(s), and repeats until the desired number of features is reached.

### 3. Model Training
- **Ensemble Models**: Various ensemble models such as StackingClassifier and VotingClassifier are trained.
- **Unsupervised Models**: Clustering techniques like K-Means and DBSCAN are used to add cluster features.

### 4. Model Evaluation
- **ROC Curves**: Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves are plotted to evaluate model performance.
- **Confusion Matrices**: Confusion matrices are used to visualize the performance of classification models.
- **Classification Reports**: Detailed reports including precision, recall, and F1-score are generated.

### 5. Visualization
- **ROC Curves**: Multi-class ROC curves are plotted to assess the performance of the models.
- **Confusion Matrices**: Normalized confusion matrices display the percentage of correct and incorrect predictions.
